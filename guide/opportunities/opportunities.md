## [Center for Robust Decision-making in Climate and Energy Policy \(RDCEP\) ****](http://www.rdcep.org/)‚≠ê üí∞

{% hint style="info" %}
**Due:** Rolling deadline until April 14th

The Data Science for Public Good \(DSPG\) program is a summer immersive program held in the Biocomplexity Institute's Social and Decision Analytics division. The program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG young scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy. For more information about the program, please contact Gizem Korkmaz at gkorkmaz@virginia.edu.
